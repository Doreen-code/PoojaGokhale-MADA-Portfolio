Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

Create an object with only data from 2000.\nafrica2000data = africadata %&gt;% filter(year==2000)\nLook at the data structure and summarize the data\nstr(africa2000data)\n\n'data.frame':   51 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  33.9 128.3 89.3 52.4 96.2 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  73.3 52.3 57.2 47.6 52.6 46.7 54.3 68.4 45.3 51.5 ...\n $ fertility       : num  2.51 6.84 5.98 3.41 6.59 7.06 5.62 3.7 5.45 7.35 ...\n $ population      : num  31183658 15058638 6949366 1736579 11607944 ...\n $ gdp             : num  5.48e+10 9.13e+09 2.25e+09 5.63e+09 2.61e+09 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\nsummary(africa2000data)\n\n         country        year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     : 1   Min.   :2000   Min.   : 12.30   Min.   :37.60  \n Angola      : 1   1st Qu.:2000   1st Qu.: 60.80   1st Qu.:51.75  \n Benin       : 1   Median :2000   Median : 80.30   Median :54.30  \n Botswana    : 1   Mean   :2000   Mean   : 78.93   Mean   :56.36  \n Burkina Faso: 1   3rd Qu.:2000   3rd Qu.:103.30   3rd Qu.:60.00  \n Burundi     : 1   Max.   :2000   Max.   :143.30   Max.   :75.00  \n (Other)     :45                                                  \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent \n Min.   :1.990   Min.   :    81154   Min.   :2.019e+08   Africa  :51  \n 1st Qu.:4.150   1st Qu.:  2304687   1st Qu.:1.274e+09   Americas: 0  \n Median :5.550   Median :  8799165   Median :3.238e+09   Asia    : 0  \n Mean   :5.156   Mean   : 15659800   Mean   :1.155e+10   Europe  : 0  \n 3rd Qu.:5.960   3rd Qu.: 17391242   3rd Qu.:8.654e+09   Oceania : 0  \n Max.   :7.730   Max.   :122876723   Max.   :1.329e+11                \n                                                                      \n                       region  \n Eastern Africa           :16  \n Western Africa           :16  \n Middle Africa            : 8  \n Northern Africa          : 6  \n Southern Africa          : 5  \n Australia and New Zealand: 0  \n (Other)                  : 0\nPlot for life expectancy as a function of infant mortality\nggplot(data=africa2000data, mapping=aes(x=infant_mortality, y=life_expectancy)) +geom_point()\nPlot for life expectancy as a function of population\nggplot(data=africa2000data, mapping=aes(x=population, y=life_expectancy)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()\nFitting a model to predict life expectancy using infant mortality\nlm_mortality = lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data=africa2000data)\nsummary(lm_mortality)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africa2000data)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.6651  -3.7087   0.9914   4.0408   8.6817 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

The R-squared is 0.005176. Thus, while infant mortality is a useful predictor, this model is not able to explain a large potion of the variability in the life expectancy, and other variables should be considered.\nFor the second model (using population), the p-value for population is greater than 0.05, thus we can conclude that population is not a useful predictor of life expectancy.\nhelp(movielens)"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/LibraryUser/Documents/GitHub/PoojaGokhale-MADA-Portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/LibraryUser/Documents/GitHub/PoojaGokhale-MADA-Portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
